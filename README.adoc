This application allows you to view, for each server in each environment,
which version of every Artifact is deployed.

It is composed of two different applications:

* `git-visu-back` is a Kotlin Spring Boot Reactive Back-End application
* `git-visu-front` is a npm VueJS Front-End application

For the deployment, one single Spring-Boot FAT jar is generated including
the production compiled front app in the back app artifact.

include::git-visu-front/README.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Running the main project

 java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=test git-visu-back-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

[NOTE]
I set the `test` profile here is to set Postgresql port to `54320` and define
Spring Security `user` and `password`
